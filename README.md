# Free Machine Learning Education

This repo contains a collection of links to free courses and educational material related to machine learning. While there are many excellent paid courses out there, such as platforms like [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), the aim of this repository is to demonstrate that you can learn everything you need to know about machine learning for free. It might require more discipline, but it's entirely possible! 

The resources are organized into four levels: Essential, Foundation, Core, and Specialization. This structure allows you to navigate the learning materials based on your current knowledge level and specific learning goals. 

The approach to learning is entirely up to you. Many learners find a top-down approach effective, as advocated by [Jeremy Howard in the fast.ai courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&t=940s). This method starts with the big picture, applying machine learning models first, and then gradually delving into the details once you understand the concept and why it is important. However, one essential prerequisite is Python. Without a solid understanding of Python, you'll find it challenging to make significant progress in machine learning. So, if you're new to Python, start there.

The Foundation level courses cover mathematical and computer science topics that underpin many machine learning algorithms. While it's beneficial to have some background knowledge in these areas, you don't necessarily need to start by diving deep into these foundations.

It's often more effective to start learning about machine learning, how to work with data, and how models work. Over time, you can supplement this practical knowledge by delving deeper into the foundational concepts.

Once you have a good understanding of machine learning and deep learning, you can move onto more specialized courses, such as the deployment of machine learning models.

## Foundation: Calculus
Calculus, particularly matrix calculus, is a fundamental branch of mathematics that plays a vital role in machine learning, especially in the optimization of machine learning models. The article [Matrix Calculus for Deep Learning](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html) provides a comprehensive overview of what is required for deep learning practitioners. Here are some example learning outcomes for studying calculus in the context of machine learning:

- Understand the concept of a function: Functions are used to represent mathematical relationships between quantities, and are fundamental to machine learning algorithms.
- Master the principles of differential calculus: This includes understanding concepts such as limits, continuity, derivatives, and the rules for differentiation. These are used in machine learning for optimization and understanding how changes in input affect the output.
- Learn about integral calculus: Understanding concepts such as integrals and the fundamental theorem of calculus is important for areas of machine learning such as probabilistic models.
- Understand multivariable calculus: Many machine learning algorithms involve functions of many variables, so understanding partial derivatives and multiple integrals is crucial.
- Learn about matrix calculus: As explained in the article, matrix calculus extends the concepts of calculus to higher dimensions. It is used extensively in deep learning for backpropagation and other optimization algorithms.
- Understand the concept of a gradient: Gradients are used in machine learning to update the parameters of models and minimize error functions.
- Understand optimization: Techniques for finding the maxima and minima of functions are used extensively in machine learning for training models.

## Foundation: Computer Science
The field of machine learning is deeply rooted in computer science, which provides the tools and frameworks that allow us to implement and optimize machine learning algorithms efficiently. It covers a wide range of topics including algorithms and data structures, which are essential for writing efficient code; computer architecture, which can be important for understanding and optimizing computational performance; and software engineering principles, which are crucial for building robust, maintainable, and scalable systems.

The level of computer science knowledge required can vary significantly depending on the role. For instance, roles such as Machine Learning Engineer or MLOps Engineer will require a deeper understanding of computer science principles as they involve designing, implementing, and maintaining machine learning systems. On the other hand, a Data Scientist might focus more on statistical analysis and data interpretation, and thus might not need as extensive a computer science background.

While this repository provides a few links to general material that may be useful in developing code, particularly in Python, there are other resources that provide a more comprehensive study of computer science. One such resource is the Open Source Society University's [Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science), which provides a great list of resources to study computer science in detail. Regardless of your role, having a solid foundation in computer science will undoubtedly be beneficial in your machine learning journey.

## Specialization: Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve a goal. The agent learns from the consequences of its actions, rather than from being explicitly taught, and adjusts its behavior based on the rewards and penalties it receives.

Key learning objectives for studying RL include:

- Understanding the basics of reinforcement learning: This includes concepts such as states, actions, rewards, and the reinforcement learning loop.
- Learning about Markov Decision Processes (MDPs): This involves understanding how MDPs provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker.
- Grasping the principles of dynamic programming: This includes learning about techniques such as policy iteration and value iteration.
- Learning about model-free methods: This involves understanding how to use techniques like Monte Carlo methods and Temporal-Difference learning for estimating value functions without a model of the environment.
- Understanding the basics of function approximation: This includes learning about techniques for dealing with large or continuous state spaces, including linear function approximation and deep learning methods.
- Learning about policy gradient methods: This involves understanding how to optimize policies directly based on the gradient ascent on the expected return.
- Understanding the use of exploration and exploitation: This includes learning about the trade-off between exploiting what you already know to gain reward and exploring the environment to find better actions.
